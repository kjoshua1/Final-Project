		<h2> <b class="title"> Introduction </b> </h2>
			<P>Sup!, My name is Kenneth Joshua A. Ramos. I'm 18 years old and originally from Urdaneta City, Pangasinan. Currently, I reside in T alonzo. My hobbies are listening to music and reading books. My favorite book is "13 Reasons why" because of its life lessons. In music, my favorite artists are Ariana Grande, Olivia Rodrigo, and Lorde. A fact about me is that I did not plan on taking BSIT, but my parents forced me to pursue it. My original course would have been Human Biology at De La Salle University because I plan to become a Neurologist someday. Cheers to those who are currently pursuing their planned courses! Hehe.</p>
